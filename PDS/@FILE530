//***FILE 530 is from Roy Gardiner and is a program written in      *   FILE 530
//*           PL/I to format PL/I programs, so they conform to a    *   FILE 530
//*           site standard.                                        *   FILE 530
//*                                                                 *   FILE 530
//*           Code can be:  indented to a selectable number of      *   FILE 530
//*           columns for DO/END SELECT/END; converted to lower     *   FILE 530
//*           case; comments moved to be more vertically aligned.   *   FILE 530
//*                                                                 *   FILE 530
//*           The code is written in legal PL/I without the use of  *   FILE 530
//*           pointers; it should thus be platform independent.     *   FILE 530
//*                                                                 *   FILE 530
//*           There are two members; some JCL to run the formatter  *   FILE 530
//*           and the formatter source code.  Instructions for      *   FILE 530
//*           parameters to the formatter are in the JCL.           *   FILE 530
